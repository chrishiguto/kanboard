This is a very simple project created to play around with [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). I'm also using a deprecated form library called [Unforms](https://github.com/unform/unform) which was a promising library at the time.
This project was bootstrapped using [Advanced React Boilerplate](https://github.com/React-Avancado/boilerplate)

## What is inside?

This project uses lot of stuff as:

- [Unforms](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Beautiful DnD](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React-Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
